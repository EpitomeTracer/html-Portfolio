<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/IMG_1173.JPG" height="200" alt="Picture of me and my kids">

<p>I am a gamer that goes by the name Epitome Tracer, one of my favorite things to do is play 
  video games and being able to stream and have fun is exciting and it is probably the most exciting
  thing that I have done besides decide to get my degree in computer science and begin coding
</p>

<p>I am a mother to three beautiful babies, ages 6, 3, and 6 months. I love my kids a ton 
  they are what push me to be better and do what I believe in, I want to show them that you 
  can love what you do and be able to do it everyday.
</p>

<p>I have been studying code for about 4 years now and it is one of my other passions in life 
  I have found that coding gives me a chance to break and fix things and just be able to continuously 
  play on a computer which is extremly fun.
