<h2>My top three favorite movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Phantom of the Opera</h3>
<p>This is one of my absolute favorite movies. This is the first movie I watched that sparked 
    my love for the theater I could watch this movie every day for the rest of my life.
</p>
<h3>Spiderman Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Being a mom of three, two of these lovelys being boys who are in love with spider man, this is probably
    my favorite spiderman movie ever made. I love marvel movies and continue to watch them all the time,
    and my boys favorite super hero is spiderman, I couldnt get them to stop watching this movie and it 
    became one of my favorites
</p>
<h3>Sleeping Beauty</h3>
<p>This Disney Classic has been one of my absolute favorites since I was a child, there is just
    something about watching a classic Disney princess movie that makes you feel all warm and 
    fuzzy and makes you happy as you remeber your favorite childhood classics.
